# Family Echo
## What is Family Echo?
Family Echo is a free online website that allows users to make their own family trees. One user can have several different family tree projects.
## How to Create a Tree on Family Echo
### Create a Family Echo Account
* Go to [https://www.familyecho.com/]
* Select ***Create a new Family Echo Account***. Enter a Username, Password, and email address.
* Family Echo is free.
### Building Your Family Tree
* You will be asked to enter your name and information; if you are making your personal family tree, do this. If you are making a historical family tree that is not personal to you, simply fill in the information for the first person in the tree you wish to include.
* After filling in the information for the first person on your tree, use the different options located on the left side of the screen to add relatives. Continue this process of adding relatives until you have included each person for your tree.
* Details can include: -Birth/Death Date -Name -Gender -Partners/Exes -Biographical Information -A Photo
* When you're ready to save you Family Tree, select ***Save***. It will automatically save the tree to your account under the title ***My Family***. To retitle the tree, go to ***My Account*** and select the ***Rename*** button next to your tree.
### Including Your Tree as an HTML iframe on your site
The technically difficulty with family echo is that its general options for exporting a family tree are slightly complicated technically, and are not compatible with Omeka, which is where this particular tree was being put. The best possible way to combat this was by using an *HTML iframe*.
* To use an iframe of your family tree, select someone on the tree *Without a Death Date* and then click to ***Share*** button; this is because Family Echo by design assumes you are working with some living people, and you therefore cannot share with a non-living person.
   * This selected person will be the first person visitors to your site will see in your iframe, if you would like the first person seen to be someone else on the tree that has a death date, go back and delete their death date. You can always re-add it after creating the iframe on your website.
* Copy the link found in the URL box.
Go to your Omeka admin dashboard for your site.
* Enter in to edit the page on wish you want to put your family tree. Select ***HTML*** above the text box for the page.
* Type < iframe src="yourcopiedlinkhere"> < /iframe>
* ***Save changes*** to the HTML Editor window.
* ***Save Changes*** to your page.
* Make sure the page is public. Your family tree should now be visible.
 * To change the dimensions of the iframe of your family tree on the site, go back into the HTML editor. Some other code will have been added automatically to the iframe you typed out. In this code you will find a spot that says width="some number" and height="some number"; alter the numbers only to adjust your preferred dimensions. Do not forget to save changes each time for the new dimensions of your iframe to take effect.
